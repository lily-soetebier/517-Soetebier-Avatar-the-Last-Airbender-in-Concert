## What is Avatar the Last Airbender?
[_Avatar the Last Airbender_][atla-wiki], is an American animated series that Aired on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008. The series takes place in an "Asiatic-inspired" high fantasy world that is divided into four nations: the Water Tribe (inspired by Inuit and Yupik Cultures), the Earth Kingdom (inspired by monarchical China), the Air Nomads (inspired by Tibetan Buddhist Monks), and the Fire Nation (inspired by imperialist Japan). 

Within the population of each of these nations are people known as "benders" who have the ability to control the elements associated with their homelands. The Avatar is a bender who has the ability to control all four of the elements, and is seen as the spiritual leader of the world who must keep the balance amongst the nations. The Avatar is reincarnated into one of the nations in the following cycle: water, earth, fire, air. 

The show begins in _media res_, dropping the viewer into the fray of a 100-year world war. It is revealed that the Fire Nation had launched an attack on all of the other nations intended to assert dominance over the rest of the nations and gain control of the whole world. They were able to continue this fight for so long because the Avatar had dissapeared in the world's time of need. 

The show follows the story of the newly returned Avatar and his quest to master all four elements in order to defeat the Fire Lord and bring peace and balance to the world. 

The story takes place over three "books" or seasonsâ€” one for each additional element the Avatar, an airbender by birth, needs to master:
Water, Earth, and Fire.

The story is so revered for its ability to conquer tough themes such as "war, genocide, imperialism, colonialism and totalitarianism, gender discrimination and female empowerment, marginalization and oppression, spirituality, as well as the philosophical questions surrounding fate, destiny, and free will", while still maintaining its position as a children's tv series.

### The Characters
The main trio of the show are: Aang, an air nomad by birth and the young avatar, Katara, the last surviving waterbender in the Souther Water Tribe, and Sokka, a non-bending Southern Water Tribe warrior and Katara's older brother.

## What is _Avatar the Last Airbender: **Live in Concert**_?
[_Avatar the Last Airbender: Live in Concert_][atla-concert] was a multimodal experience. A small chamber orchestra performed selections from the soundtrack in real time with scenes from the show. What made this concert experience truly special is that despite the show's release 20 years ago, the only soundtrack widly avaiable is for the first "book" or season of the show, while the concert included selections from the other two books as well.

### The Logisitcs
The orchestra is currently touring around the United States and is playing in symphony halls in major cities. This particular concert took place in the [Durham Performing Arts Center on Sunday August 25, 2024 at 6:30pm][dpac]. The show had a 2 hour and 40 minute run time, including a 20 minute intermission.

The concert itself was divded into three acts, one for each book of the show, plus an encore.

### The Music
The orchestra was comprised of only one or two mucisians per instrument, and four vocalists. In addition to western instruments, traditional Asian instruments such as the taiko and ehru joined the ensemble to create a truly beautiful sound that captured the essence of and inspiration for the show.

Each track from the soundtrack was named either prior to or after the play through to give the audience reference to the visuals they were about to see/had seen.

### The Visuals
The visual element is what made this experience truly unique. In time with the soundtrack, edited scenes from the show were played. Often times these scenes included iconic fights, lines of dialogue, and moments of character growth that captured the emotions that endeared the audience to the show in the first place.

In addition to these projections, the crew made use of the stage lighting to both highlight the soloists and to pull the epic visuals off the screen and into the theater.


## Review
### The First Impression
I was initially surprised at how small the orchestra was. As someone who is used to attending traditional Western orchestra/symphony concerts I was expecting a much graner scale. I was immediately impressed by their ability to fill the concert hall with music in a manner that matched the epic story on the screen.

### The Good
The experience itself was truly unlike any concert I had ever been to. The atmosphere of the audience I think was a major factor in this feeling. The announcer at the beginning made it clear that this as an audience we didn't have to follow the strict sense of concert ettiquette required at traditional orchestra concerts, and the crowd really took this to heart.  Combined with the relative small size of the orchestra the environment was extremly intimate. There were cheers and tears as triumph and tradgedy flashed across the screen.

What I found most impressive about the muscianship was the use of vocal percussion and chanting within certain pieces. Often these moments would go on for nearly a full minute and the amount of breath control and concentration required to accomplish such a feat is worth commending. Overall the production itself was beautifully executed and immensely enjoyable.

### The Not so Good
While I understand the need to condense the show to fit within the 2 hour and 40 minute run time, I felt as though a few piovotal plot points were not fully developed and certain characters were not featured as often as they should be. For example, two memebers of Team Avatar, as the main group of characters that travel with Aang through his trainin are referred to in the show, Sokka and Toph each had one moment of solo feature, but then were scarely featured in the music and the visual scenes provided. Additionally certain characters were never formally introduced, but were featured in several scenes, such as Mai and Ty Lee, Azula's companions. This led to a disjointed version of the plot that meant that experience could only really be enjoyed by those who had seen the show before.

### The Final Verdit
While there was definite room for improvement, the experience of _Avatar the Last Airbender: Live in Concert_ was one that I will not be soon to forget and has changed my perception of the soundtrack as a whole. I look forward to rewatching the show with the perspective I now have on the score behind the scenes.
